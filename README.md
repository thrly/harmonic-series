# [harmonic series generator](https://thrly.github.io/harmonic-series/)

_a synthesizer for exploring the timbre of the natural harmonic series_

![generative wandering harmonic series](/harmonic-synth.gif)

> A harmonic is an integer multiple of a fundamental frequency. For example:
> 
> Fundamental (𝑓) is 55 Hz; 
> Second harmonic (𝑓2) = 𝑓∗2= 110 Hz; 
> Third harmonic (𝑓3) = 𝑓∗3= 165 Hz and so on...

## Instructions
1. Open the synth: https://thrly.github.io/harmonic-series/
2. Set a fundamental frequency (default 55 Hz) on top-right.
3. Use the 'Start/Stop' button to turn audio on/off.
4. Adjust the gain of each partial to mix harmonics.
5. The 'Randomise' button (or R key) will set a random gain for each partial, creating new timbres.
6. The 'Wander' button will start the partials automatically moving. Control speed with Wander slider.
7. 'Static' stops generative behaviour.
8. 'Save CSV' (bottom-right) exports information about harmonic pitch and amplitude (0-1) or current spectra.

This instrument was made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [p5.js-sound](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound)
